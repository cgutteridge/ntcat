(let me know if you find it useful)


This is a simple command-line tool which will concatinate two or more 
files in ntriples[1] format. It will insert a prefix before blank node
identifiers in each file to ensure they don't clash. eg.

File 1. contains

_:id1 <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Alice Smith" .
_:id1 <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person> .

File 2. contains

_:id1 <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Bob Jones" .
_:id1 <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person> .

The result would be:

_:Aid1 <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Alice Smith" .
_:Aid1 <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person> .
_:Bid1 <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Bob Jones" .
_:Bid1 <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person> .

The prefixes are inserted to stop the node IDs clashing. A-Z are used then 
a-z. If more than 52 files are being merged then the prefixes will use two
characters, AA to Az then BA to Bz etc.

This script was designed to be used in concert with the rapper[2] command-line tool.

A possible future extension would be to have it accept files via STDIN with 
a "NEWFILE" line to indicate it should increment the bnode prefix.
